    <h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
        <p>We created a realistic fluid simulation based on particle positions in C++ based off of <a href="http://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf">this </a>paper on Position Based Fluids by Macklin and Muller.</p>
        <p>Our original project proposal can be seen <a href="index.html" target="_blank">here</a> and a powerpoint version of our project report can be seen <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Wuz9Tkz9u8N81KytmdWsyhRwPin_yG40662PYKs_7hA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.
    <h2 align="middle">Technical Summary</h2>   
    <h3>Neighboring Particles' Grid Structure</h3>
        <p>We needed an efficient way to get the neighbors of a particular particle.</p>
        <p>We used <b>unordered_map</b> in c++, which allows constant time access, to map a grid to a list of particles in that grid (hash grid). Each grid is defined by 3 coordinate values and for each particle, we would store it in the grid {floor(x/h), floor(y/h), floor(z/h)} where x, y, z are the coordinates of a particle and h is the kernel size parameter.Increasing the kernel size parameter would allow for more particles to be mapped to the same grid. Each grid would hash to a value floor(x/h) +  1300583*floor(y/h) + 105607*floor(z/h).</p>
        <p>The neighbors of a certain particle will be contained in the 27 neighboring grids, including the grid that the particle maps to. </p>
        <p>We could have used a big 3D array to store the grid, which would have been faster. However, this approach saves memory.</p>
    <h3>Incompressibility</h3>
        <p>Enforcing incompressibility is the most important aspect of fluid simulation in order to make the simulation realistic.</p>
        <p>In order to achieve this, we uses SPH and PBD solvers that we will go over more in detail below.</p>
    <h3>Density Estimator</h3>
        <p>In order to maintain constant density, we set up density constraints for each particle as below:</p>
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>
                    <td align="middle">
                    <img src="images/densityconstraint.png" width="200px" />
                    <figcaption align="middle"></figcaption>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p>In the above formula, p<sub>1</sub> through p<sub>n</sub> are the positions of neighboring particles found through the method in the neighboring particles grid structure section, p<sub>0</sub> is rest density, which we defined to be 1000kg/m<sup>3</sup>, and p<sub>i</sub> is the density of the particle at i.</p>
        <p>In order to find the density of the particle at i, we use smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) estimators found by Monaghan in 1992, which is the formula below</p>
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>
                    <td align="middle">
                    <img src="images/density.png" width="200px" />
                    <figcaption align="middle"></figcaption>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p>In the above formula, we are summing over all the neighbors of the particle i, ,m<sub>j</sub> is the mass of the neighboring particle which we defined to be equal to 1 to simplify calculations, h is the smoothing radius which we set to be equal to the kernel size (which is 0.14). Below is the function W, which is the smoothing kernel defined in Muller et al 2003. </p>
       <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>
                    <td align="middle">
                    <img src="images/smooth.png" width="300px" />
                    <figcaption align="middle"></figcaption>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p>We use the smoothing kernel to solve for the density estimator. </p>
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>
                    <td align="middle">
                    <img src="images/kernels.png" width="500px" />
                    <figcaption align="middle">In order of appearance: smoothing kernel, spiky kernel, viscosity kernel</figcaption>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p>Notice how in the above image, the gradient of the smoothing kernel approaches zero at the center. Thus, if we use this kernel to calculate the pressure forces, particles will end up clumping due to the high pressure and the repulsion force vanishes since gradient is zero at the center. Thus we use the spiky kernel (which you can see in the above image to the right of the smoothing kernel) for pressure computations (aka gradient calculation) that we will mention below. </p>
    <h3>Gradient Calculation</h3>
        <p>We integrate the density solver with position based dynamics (PBD) framework. The specific deriviation of how the density solver is integrated of the below formulas are mentioned in the Macklin and Muller 2003 paper. PBD is a non-linear constraint solver that is unconditionally stable. It tries to optimize the cost function below</p>
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>
                    <td align="middle">
                    <img src="images/constaint.png" width="150px" />
                    <figcaption align="middle"></figcaption>

            </table>
        </div>
        <p>It attempts to find a delta p with the goal of making the density constraint zero. We solve this by using a series of Newton steps along the constraint gradient. For each constraint, we project particles along the constraint gradient and apply newton’s method to each constraint until it converges. A simple image demonstration of how this works from Macklin’s powerpoint slides is shown below. </p>
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>

                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p>The actual formula to solve the density constraint is below, where we sum over the neighboring particles and the partial derivative of W is the spiky kernel mentioned above:</p>
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>
                    <td align="middle">
                    <img src="images/delta.png" width="300px"/>
                    <figcaption align="middle">Note the lambdas, the scorr, and the upside-down triangle function of W, which is the spiky kernel</figcaption>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p>The spiky kernel, as mentioned above, is a modification of the smooth kernel, and is defined below:</p>
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>
                    <td align="middle">

                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p>The lambdas are a scaling factor that are defined as such, where epsilon is a user defined relaxation parameter that we set to be 10,000:</p>
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>

                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p>Partial derivative of the constraint is defined as such:</p>
        <div align="center">

                <tr>

                    <figcaption align="middle">Note the two different cases</figcaption>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
    <h3>Artificial Pressure</h3>
        <p>In our implementation, we experienced clumping of particles, which is the result of negative pressure when particle does not have enough neighbors to satisfy to SPH density constraint since SPH requires a minimum number of neighbor. As a result, the particles pull each other together to reach rest density and satisfy the constraint. </p>
        <p>In order to counter this, we added artificial pressure to the calculation of position delta in order to add a small repulsive force to create surface tension.</p>
        <p>The artificial pressure is defined in terms of the smoothing kernel as below:</p>
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>
                    <td align="middle">
                    <img src="images/scorr.png" width="250px"/>
                    <figcaption align="middle"></figcaption>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p>We defined magnitude of delta q to be 0.1 * the kernel size and k to be 0.001 and n to be 4 as mentioned in the paper. Take note back to the scorr in the formula to solve the density constraint above.
        <p>You will see in the results the effect the artificial pressure has on our demo.</p>
    <h3>Collision Detection</h3>
        <p>For collision detect, we made it very simple. We set the position to the boundary coordinate if it is greater than or equal to the coordinate, and the velocity gets modified through the formula mentioned below. So if a coordinate is at the boundary of y = -1, we just set the position's y to be -1. </p>
    <h3>Algorithm (Pseudocode)</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Apply gravity and predict position after gravity is applied using the formulas <b>v = v + dt * gravity</b> and <b>newp = p + dt * v </b></li>
        <li>Find new_p's neighboring particles using hash grid structure</li>
        <li>Newtonian iterative solver (which we set to be 10 iterations):
            <ol type="a">
            <li>Calculated the step size using kernels from Muller et al 2003 for density estimator</li>
            <li>Found the position delta for each particle and collision detection</li>
            <li>Updated the new positions with the position delta</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Update Velocity and Position using the formulas <b> v = 1/dt * (newp - p)</b> and <b> p = newp </b></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note how we only update the variable new position variable "newp" and not the original position "p" until the final step when we set the old position to "new position". Also, we set dt to be 0.001. Smaller time steps lead to less clumping of particles, even though it makes the rendering slower.</p>
    <h2 align="middle">Results</h2>
        <p>Here are the videos of our demo’s of our program working.</p>

        <p>Description: This is the case of our program running without artificial pressure. Notice that there is a lot more splashing and there is less surface tension.

        <p>Description: This is the case of our program running without artificial pressure. Notice that there the particles tend to stick together more, drastically reducing the splashing effect from the case without artificial pressure because of the repulsive force added in by scorr.</p>
        <a href = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6eUQqYixEJiVzRveXQ2dEh4SFk/view?usp=sharing"> 10x10x10 with artificial pressure with relaxation parameter 100000</a>
        <p>Description: This is the case of our program running with artificial pressure but with a higher relaxation parameter. There is more splashing than the case with a lower relaxation parameter, but a lot less than the case without artificial pressure. This is one case where tuning a parameter will affect our results.</p>
        <p>We also attempted optimizations such as OpenMP in the bottleneck sections of our program, to make our program faster, but there was no noticeable speedup in our program. A good way to expand on this project would to make it run faster through more utilizations of multi-threaded computing and GPU through CUDA to store the hash structure. Also, a good addition would be to produce a better rendering of the fluids to look more like water instead of just spherical objects.</p>
